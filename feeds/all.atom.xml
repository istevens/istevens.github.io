to write — days like this one. Let's continue with &lt;a class="reference external" href="//istevens.github.io/daily250/why-i-enjoy-taking-pictures.html"&gt;yesterday's topic of
photography&lt;/a&gt;, something which I
do every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my own film camera when I was about 8. It was a black plastic 35mm
point-and-shoot, a real beauty, with manual advance and rewind crank. I liked
the rewind crank, which was a satisfying end-of-roll ritual. Automatic rewind
mechanisms just aren't as fun. There's still the satisfaction of a finished
roll but less direct involvement, less anticipation; just push a button.
Of course, you can never finish a roll on a digital camera; there's no notion
of being &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="idea container"&gt;
Here's an idea: Design a digital camera or app with a configurable &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot;
size, and don't allow the user to review pictures until the roll is done and
they turn a physical or virtual crank. This way, the photographer can be
more focused on taking the shots without breaking flow, and can self-impose
a goal without having to keep track of the number of photos taken.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second camera was an ugly, light grey, brick of a point-and-shoot, with a
sliding lens cover, automatic advance, push-button rewind, and flash. I don't
remember this camera as fondly as my first one. I must have treasured it as I
remember being quite upset when the case cracked after the camera fell to the
sidewalk on a trip to Montreal. This camera lasted me into university, where it
was was only used at parties and other events where I didn't want my SLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, my first SLR. My father bought me a Pentax 35mm SLR with a 50mm lens
for a birthday when I was in second or third year of university. Many shots I
took were out of focus, but this was the camera which introduced me to
photography as a practice, not just as a means of capturing images. In
retrospect, I'm fairly certain I had no idea how to properly expose a frame for
the shot I wanted. Instead, I blindly followed the internal light meter. I
bought a bulky low-end Sigma zoom lens for versatility, but I never truly
explored the 50mm lens until very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}20160831-digital-cameras.rst"&gt;my first digital cameras&lt;/a&gt;, something which I'll complete in a
later post.&lt;/p&gt;

photography:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[…] I bought a compact mirrorless digital camera to supplement my hefty and
neglected DSLR. After daily practice with my new camera, I decided to
continue the trend and try to take at least one picture every day. Several
months later, I'm still on track and my photography is much-improved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been taking pictures since I was perhaps 8. The exact age I received
my first camera — a black plastic 35mm point-and-shoot — escapes me, but I
distinctly remember a few shots I took at the time. In one, I've directed
someone to shoot me with my hand extended along a wall to a patch of sunlight.
In another, my sister stands with one of our cats. A series of photos shows my
bike and bikes of friends decorated for a contest at the Uxbridge Fall Fair.
We're all still in elementary school in the pictures, probably grade 3 or 4.
Clearly, I need to find these photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my hand was in that patch of sunlight, I'm certain there was someone
telling me the shot wouldn't turn out. I went ahead anyway, and have been
experimenting with light, shadow, and colour ever since. Why? I've used
photography to document events, people, and places — as most have — but why
fiddle with it, why play with and push its boundaries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- My Dad had an interest in photography and owned a Pentax SLR along with four
or five lenses. His youngest brother was a professional photographer, but I
rarely saw him as he lived in England. My father was strictly a portrait
photographer.  He would often say that a photo needs a subject, and would
offer this advice whenever I pointed my camera at some random landscape.
Practically every shot my Dad took has a person in its borders. My
experimentation with photography wasn't learned, nor was it ever a shared
experience. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each shutter release records one face of an infinitely-faceted truth. I've
always been eager to unveil which facet the camera has captured. Digital
cameras immediately reward that anticipation, for better or for worse, but I
still feel it. I've also never lost the desire to influence which truth the
camera records. That desire is partly one of control (through manual exposure,
for example), but also a desire to introduce a little randomness, such as by
shooting with a manual lens. In this way, each shutter release also results in
a delightful surprise, yet one which I've heavily influenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography for me is a desire to record a truth, to play with that truth, but
also to experience joy witnessing a surprising take on that same truth. These
desires lead me and others to find beauty in the unexpected — people who love
pictures of decay, for example — or find a unique way to represent beauty that
is more conventional. Photography can then be thought of as part
problem-solving using science and creativity, and part serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, problem-solving using science (math, really) and creativity can
be used to describe software development, something I've explored and enjoyed
about as long as I've explored photography.&lt;/p&gt;

so that I could spend the summer with my then six-month-old son. Around the
same time, I bought a compact mirrorless digital camera to supplement my hefty
and neglected DSLR. After daily practice with my new camera, I decided to
continue the trend and try to take at least one picture every day. Several
months later, I'm still on track and my photography is much-improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I wondered which other activity could benefit from daily
practice. Writing seemed like an obvious choice, requiring limited tools and a
small time commitment. My daily writing regimen has three restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write and publish at least 250 words on a topic decided that day,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write with limited &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s5dp"&gt;repetition and deviation&lt;/a&gt; from the topic, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with my photography, I want to create good pieces, but good pieces every day
is not a requirement. Most of what I write will be absolute garbage, as
evidenced by this first post. Most people reading my writing won't find it
interesting. That's OK, I'm not writing for them —&amp;nbsp;I'm writing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that writing will become easier and more enjoyable. As a child I was
fond of writing, but these days my writing is limited to business contexts and
trying to cram thoughts into &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/istevens"&gt;140 characters on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Fun, sometimes, but not expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping that future attempts don't need sentences like these to pad out
the length requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
