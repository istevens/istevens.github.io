</header>

                <p>What better day than an Apple product launch day to write about my relationship
with Apple? I was never one to make fun of Apple products — they always seemed
like great machines, and fun to use. A company I worked for in 1995 made heavy
use of Macs, which were a joy to use after DOS, OS/2, and early versions of
Windows.</p>
<p>My very first Apple product was an Apple SE I bought for $5 at a University of
Waterloo surplus sale around 1998. I never used this seriously and bought it as
a joke. I've since lost track of the SE's whereabouts.</p>
<p>I bought my first Apple product, a Powerbook G5, in 2005 after
years of using DOS or Linux variants on PC hardware. Mac OS, with BSD under the
hood, was a Unix OS put out by a company passionate about user experience, and
I was sold. Sure, it cost more than Linux machines I could piece together
myself, and spend days tweaking kernel settings, kernel modules, and
distribution-specific configuration, and that was fine by me. My Powerbook also
came with some great Apple software — Garageband, iMovie, iTunes, etc. — with no
equal on Linux, free or otherwise.</p>
<p>The Powerbook was my only laptop for eight years. These days it looks like a
cobbled-together rough prototype of an Apple laptop, but it still works. As
with my other computers, I stayed with my Powerbook until I couldn't put up
with it anymore. I supplemented my laptop experience with both an iPod Touch
and iPad, and was able to put off buying another laptop because of that.</p>
<p>My next laptop after my Powerbook is my current laptop, a Macbook Pro I bought
in 2013 which shows no sign of slowing down. In over eleven years I have only
owned two laptops. The so-called &quot;Apple Tax&quot; has been worth it for me. (That
said, in over twenty-five years I have owned only five computers, so this could
be just part of a personal trend.)</p>
<p>I have never regretted buying into Apple's products or ecosystem. I have no
complaints. Apple's build quality has meant that I can continue using their
products for longer than competing systems would have retained their value. I
still use my iPod Touch (the first of the Retina Display generation) and iPad 2
on a daily basis. I have no iPhone, though, but that's a different story.</p>

                <p>I've taken at least one picture every day since I bought my Olympus E-M10 in
May. I take my camera almost everywhere and take most of my pictures while I'm
out running errands. Every few days I may go walking with the goal of taking
pictures. Last week ...</p>

                <p>As a father of two, I'll sometimes get asked for advice from mothers or
fathers expecting their first-born. &quot;Don't listen to others' advice. Do what's
right for you,&quot; I'll say, before launching into some advice which likely isn't
right for them.</p>
<p>One of those nuggets ...</p>

                <p>I don't remember how it started, but every night before going to bed, my
daughter has her teeth cleaned by one of her dentists. At last count, I think
she has six who come by regularly, and they often tuck her in as well. A
dentist will rarely come ...</p>
