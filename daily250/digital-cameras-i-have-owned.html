</header>
        <p><a class="reference external" href="//istevens.github.io/daily250/film-cameras-i-have-owned.html">I've owned at least three film cameras</a> in my life, and four digital cameras in
the past fifteen years. This is the nature of digital. Film cameras can remain
useful until they break, yet a digital camera will likely lose its usefulness
once it lags behind cameras new to the market. Every digital camera I have
owned still works, yet they are no longer &quot;useful&quot; to me. Arguably film cameras
are useless in their inconvenience, although they still have use as niche or
retro tools. An old digital camera may produce unacceptable pictures, while
an old film camera can still produce images of acceptable quality, but which
take more effort to develop.</p>
<p>I bought my first digital camera, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20, in the mid 2000s.
Clunky by today's standards, I chose this quasi-DSLR as a starter camera to
introduce me to digital images. The lens was fixed, and the camera sensor was
inadequate with darker indoor shots, but it was my primary camera for several
years. I can't say that I loved this camera. As times its performance in low
light frustrated me, but I made it work. I was able to add some filters using
an extension which attached to the lens, but that was the limit of my
personalization. Eventually I gave the Lumix to a sister-in-law.</p>
<p>My first DSLR was a Nikon D80, which I bought second-hand off of a friend of
mine. Although I was able to make use of multiple lenses for the first time
since my Pentax SLR, I only bought and used two lenses: a sharp 50mm f1.8
Nikkor lens, and a Tamron zoom lens. I was finally able to experiment with
depth-of-field again. The Nikkor sharpness spoiled me though, and I rarely used
the zoom as it was too bulky for everyday use. I loved this camera, so much so
that when it suddenly stopped working after a year, I paid about as much to
repair it as I did to buy it used.</p>
<p>Of all the cameras I have owned, the Nikon D80 truly introduced me to <em>serious
photography</em>. It was better for indoor shots than my Lumix, and the Nikkor 50mm
lens I used was my best lens since the one I used with my Pentax SLR. I really
was in heaven, especially after the birth of my daughter, who provided me
with plenty of opportunities for great pictures. At some point I grew tired of
the D80, and taking it out for pictures became a chore. As with my Lumix, I
found myself pushing against the limits of what the D80 could do. While better
in low-light, indoor photography, particularly in the darker winter months, was
often lackluster. Most importantly, the D80 was too cumbersome and noticeable
for candid shots, which is likely why I eventually stopped using it outside of
special events, outdoor shots, and vacations.</p>
<p>To fill in where the D80 couldn't go, I bought a Lumix point-and-shoot. It
could fit in a pocket and took decent pictures. Focusing was often slow,
though, and this camera was more utilitarian than a love-affair. Let us not
speak of it again.</p>
<p>This brings me to my most recent camera, an Olympus OM-D E-M10. I could easily
write an entire post on how it has changed my photography. Size-wise,
the E-M10 fits between my first black plastic film camera and my Lumix FZ20.
This makes it extremely portable, and I think nothing of carrying it even when
running errands. I have used it for only four months, and have taken at
least one picture every day. A huge selling feature for me is the ease at which
I can use manual lenses. Although I tried attaching a manual lens to my Nikon
D80, the resulting image looked like one produced by a toy camera. I use a
different lens on the Olympus every few days, and have only had positive
experiences.</p>
<p>I'll write more about my recent photographic experience, but this wraps up my
catalog of cameras I have owned, at least for a few more years.</p>
