                <p>This past April I ended a contracting gig I'd been on for two-and-a-half years
so that I could spend the summer with my then six-month-old son. Around the
same time, I bought a compact mirrorless digital camera to supplement my hefty
and neglected DSLR. After daily practice with my new camera, I decided to
continue the trend and try to take at least one picture every day. Several
months later, I'm still on track and my photography is much-improved.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I wondered which other activity could benefit from daily
practice. Writing seemed like an obvious choice, requiring limited tools and a
small time commitment. My daily writing regimen has three restrictions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Write and publish at least 250 words on a topic decided that day,</li>
<li>Write with limited <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s5dp">repetition and deviation</a> from the topic, and</li>
<li>Have fun.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As with my photography, I want to create good pieces, but good pieces every day
is not a requirement. Most of what I write will be absolute garbage, as
evidenced by this first post. Most people reading my writing won't find it
interesting. That's OK, I'm not writing for them â€”&nbsp;I'm writing for me.</p>
<p>My hope is that writing will become easier and more enjoyable. As a child I was
fond of writing, but these days my writing is limited to business contexts and
trying to cram thoughts into <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/istevens">140 characters on Twitter</a>. Fun, sometimes, but not expressive.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that future attempts don't need sentences like these to pad out
the length requirement.</p>
