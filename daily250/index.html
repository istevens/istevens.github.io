</header>

                <p>Today I'm writing about a topic which I have never written about but practice
every day: fashion. Fashion for me is two-thirds fit and one-third styling. I
could love the style of a piece of clothing, but if it doesn't satisfy my four
criteria for fit then I won't wear it. These criteria are length, volume, arms
and shoulders, and crotch. Yes, crotch.</p>
<p>I am a slim man of below-average height. Historically this has meant that I've
had to settle for clothing just slightly too large for my body. In most stores,
small was never small enough. Over the past few years it's been a little easier
to find clothes that fit, thanks to a trend towards slimmer clothing and my
ability to shell out for higher-end pieces which, typically, fit better and
come in smaller sizes.</p>
<p>The first two criteria for fit, length and volume, are fairly self-explanatory.
Length applies mostly to shirts, sweaters, and jackets, as pants can be readily
hemmed. A piece of clothing that's too long will make me look shorter, so I am
vigilant about buying items which sit well at the waist. Shirts (except dress
shirts) and sweaters should fall just below the waist. Jackets shouldn't
descend below buttocks, except for warmth. Pants can be hemmed, but features
which should be at the knees or thighs, such as artificial wear, should sit
appropriately. Shorts for me should not fall below the knees.</p>
<p>Volume refers to how much extra fabric a garment appears to have when I put it
on. Do shirts billow in the arms or torso? They're not for me. Is the shape of
my legs hidden by my pants? Put them back, and get a slimmer pair. Bulky items
make me look smaller, so I need to buy clothes with a more precise fit than
others can get away with.</p>
<p>Specific to shirts and jackets, the shoulders of a garment need to meet my
shoulders. Clothing which is even slightly wide at the shoulders can often make
me look sloppy. If a piece's shoulder seam — where the front and back panels
meet the arms — drops too low, I won't buy it.</p>
<p>This brings me to the crotch — namely the inseam, yoke, and pockets. Inseams
on any pants I buy shouldn't fall too low. A relaxed fit can have a larger
inseam, but not by much. Similarly, the yoke (the V-shaped section below the
waist in jeans and other pants) and back pockets should stay high. If they are
too low, the pant's back pockets will descend under the buttocks, making the
pants appear too large on me.</p>
<p>My four criteria for fit aren't set in stone, but I've found that I won't feel
my best if I stray too far and compromise on size. Pieces I've bought where
I've compromised on fit usually stay in the closet.</p>

</header>

                <p>My wife and I are in our late 30s and early 40s with two children, so it's
often surprising to some that we rent our home. We weighed the options, and
decided on renting over buying for three main reasons. First, financials make
buying seem like a risk, at ...</p>

                <p>What better day than an Apple product launch day to write about my relationship
with Apple? I was never one to make fun of Apple products — they always seemed
like great machines, and fun to use. A company I worked for in 1995 made heavy
use of Macs, which were ...</p>

May. I take my camera almost everywhere and take most of my pictures while I'm
out running errands. Every few days I may go walking with the goal of taking
pictures. Last week ...</p>
