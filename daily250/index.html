</header>

                <p><a class="reference external" href="//istevens.github.io/daily250/first-post.html">Two weeks ago I started writing at least 250 words a day</a>. It's been a challenging fourteen days, each
day trying to find something I could ramble on for 250 words. Some posts were a
real slog, as I either couldn't decide on a topic or didn't have the desire to
reach the target word count. Some were easy — almost too easy — and needed to be
reined in to stay on topic.</p>
<p>The toughest post (after this one) was probably about <a class="reference external" href="//istevens.github.io/daily250/my-long-term-relationship-with-apple.html">my long-term relationship with
Apple</a>. How was I able to squeeze out
250 words on Apple crap I've owned? That's 62 words on each Apple product!</p>
<p>The easiest post was likely <a class="reference external" href="//istevens.github.io/daily250/the-photowalk-that-almost-was-my-last.html">the photowalk that almost was my
last</a>. It was also fun weaving a small
narrative with a little bit of tension. I'd write more like that just to try
and create an interesting story from an everyday happening.</p>
<p>I may not be able to continue writing 250 words a day on a different topic
forever. I haven't set a goal yet. I think a month is a good start. That would
provide at least 7500 words — about as much as for a novelette.</p>
<p>If I can carry this on for a month, I feel I may find it easier to commit to
250 words every day, or I may exhaust the easier topics until at some point I
am forced to yammer on about quantum mechanics. I haven't yet resorted to
drawing a topic out of a hat. It's not beneath me.</p>

                <p>In the past sixteen years, I have owned only three cellphones. While <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-keep-their-cellphones-longer-1461007321">others

I have replaced my phone every five years. How is this possible? I use a
feature phone.</p>

every day: fashion. Fashion for me is two-thirds fit and one-third styling. I
