</header>
        <p>My wife and I are in our late 30s and early 40s with two children, so it's
often surprising to some that we rent our home. We weighed the options, and
decided on renting over buying for three main reasons. First, financials make
buying seem like a risk, at least in some areas. Second, moving to areas in
which we can afford to live would mean a drastic change in our lifestyle.
Lastly, we like the flexibility of renting, for the time-being.</p>
<p>House prices have been on an upward trend for eight or so years now,
particularly in large urban areas. During the same time period, earnings have
not kept pace with housing gains. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/mortgages-and-rates/canadas-old-standards-of-housing-affordability-need-an-update/article27126408/">In 2015, the house price-to-income ratio
stood at 8.2 for Toronto</a>,
well above <a class="reference external" href="http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/now-and-then-do-canadian-homes-really-cost-that-much-more-than-30-years-ago">the ratio of 3.4 in 1985</a>.
Toronto has become less affordable with more people spending outside of their
means. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/debt-income-1.3486811">Canada's debt-to-income ratio is also at an all-time high of 165%</a>. At the same time,
Canadians are increasingly likely to live paycheque-to-paycheque, with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/half-of-working-canadians-living-paycheque-to-paycheque-survey/article31741113/">48% of
us one pay period away from needing help on bill payments</a>.
We have a situation where people are buying homes they can't afford,
maintaining a lifestyle they can't manage, with half of us a missed paycheque
away from missed payments. Something is going to give, and I don't want to be
holding real estate purchased at an all-time high when it happens.</p>
<p>The solution to house unaffordability is usually to buy where it's affordable.
Simple enough for some, but we like urban areas which are &quot;walkable&quot;, where
there are stores, parks, and activities close by. Trouble is, these areas often
have some of the highest-price real-estate. If we were to buy a house we could
afford on our terms (20% down, priced so we could carry it at twice the current
rate of interest), we'd have to move to the suburbs. That move would mean a
major change to our lifestyle: we'd see our friends far, far less; have to
change employers or spend more time commuting; and have to finance a car (or two)
for all the driving we'd need to do. Sure, we'd have a home, but we'd be
miserable, and for what? There are other investment options. Renting allows us
to live in areas we may have been unable to afford.</p>
<p>Speaking of happiness, the idea of maintaining a house does not fill us with
joy. We're not handy, so we'd be paying for most of our renovations and
repairs. When we rent, if something goes wrong we pick up the phone and someone
else handles it. If they do a poor job, that's someone else's consideration.
Does this mean we're shirking responsibility? Absolutely, and it means we can
focus our energies where we'll be happy, like travel.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for not shoveling money into a house is flexibility.
Renting gives us flexibility: move when we want, where we want. True, our
landlord also has the flexibility to sell the place and kick us out, but we can
mitigate that. Moving where we want can also mean moving to another country for
a year or two, which is something we plan on doing in a year or two, and
something which owning would have made more difficult. We'd like to live
out-of-country for the experience, and don't want to maintain two homes while
doing so.</p>
<p>We rent now, but that's not to say we're against owning a home. We'll do it
when it's right for us, and we don't want it to seriously alter our lifestyle
for what is, ultimately, one investment vehicle among many.</p>
