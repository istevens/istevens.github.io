        <p>As a father of two, I'll sometimes get asked for advice from mothers or
fathers expecting their first-born. &quot;Don't listen to others' advice. Do what's
right for you,&quot; I'll say, before launching into some advice which likely isn't
right for them.</p>
<p>One of those nuggets of baby wisdom I offer is that &quot;Other parents are the
worst.&quot; If you're a new parent, you may not realise that your style of looking
after your kids will drastically differ from those of your friends, family, and
neighbours. It's usually easy to shrug others' parenting quirks off — they may
not be <em>that</em> different from your own, and they're not impacting your
relationship.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you wonder whether other parents are even thinking. Seeing the worst
of these in public is often shocking. Take today for instance. We witnessed
grandparents &quot;discovering&quot; the power of YouTube to keep their preschool
grandson quiet and eating. This at our local comics-themed diner. Granny called
her daughter on the phone to tell her the great news — turns out, daughter's
already hip to it and uses YouTube all the time during dinner! &quot;It's the only
way I can get him to eat.&quot; Uh, did you try using hunger?</p>
<p>Less than an hour later, with my daughter at a playground, I see a five- or
six-year-old boy complain to his mother that a child had bitten him. The boy
then goes on to proclaim that he's going to &quot;put him in the garbage.&quot; His
mother, thankfully, says that, no, you don't do that. Without missing a beat,
the mother then tells her son that if someone bites him, he should push them
back. She repeats this advice two or three times — &quot;Someone bites you, you push
them back&quot; — and then goes around the playground, with her son, looking for the
boy who bit him.</p>
<p>My advice to new parents: Don't be <em>those</em> parents.</p>
